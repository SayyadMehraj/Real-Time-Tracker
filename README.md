# Real-Time Location Tracker

The Real-Time Location Tracker is a web application built on Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js, designed to provide seamless real-time location updates. Users can share their live location with others, and all updates are displayed dynamically on an interactive map.

# Key Features:
- Live Location Updates: Users can instantly share their current location with others connected to the application.
- Interactive Map: Utilizes Leaflet.js to display user locations on a responsive and interactive map interface.
- User Management: Handles user connections and disconnections, notifying all users of changes in real-time.
- High Accuracy: Ensures precise location tracking with support for high accuracy settings on supported devices.
- How It Works:
 The application utilizes Socket.io for real-time communication between the server and clients. When a user connects, their location updates are broadcasted to all connected clients, updating markers on the map in real-time. Disconnections are also handled gracefully, removing markers from the map when users disconnect.

# Technologies Used:
- Node.js: Backend server environment for handling requests and managing real-time connections.
- Express: Web application framework used for routing and middleware management.
- Socket.io: Library for real-time web applications, enabling bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- Leaflet.js: Open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
